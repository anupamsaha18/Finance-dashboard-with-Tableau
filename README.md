Problem statement:
In this project, you will create a comprehensive company finance dashboard using Tableau. You have data on revenue, profit/loss, operational insights, expenses, current assets, liabilities, and cash flow â€“ the vital components that drive the financial heartbeat of a company.

You have to create a dynamic and user-friendly dashboard that offers a bird's eye view of the company's financial health. Dive deep into the numbers, transforming raw data into insightful visualizations that empower decision-makers to glean actionable insights at a glance. Consider employing interactive elements, intuitive design, and a blend of charts, graphs, and tables to deliver a compelling narrative.

3.Current assets balance sheet data: Provides an overview of the company's current assets, showing their financial health at different points
in time.

4.CashFlow pivot table data: Summarizes the company's cash flow from financing, investing, and operating activities, along with total cash flow, over time.

5.Revenue profit PnL data: Contains a comprehensive profit and loss statement, detailing revenue, profits, and various expenses over the years.

Emphasis should be placed on clarity, accuracy, and relevance. Additionally, your dashboard should allow for customization and exploration, enabling users to drill down into specific metrics for a closer examination.
